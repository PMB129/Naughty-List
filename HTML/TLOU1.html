                <h2 class="subtitle">Game Plot</h2>
                <p>The Last of Us takes place in the year 2033, twenty years after a fungal-based, brain-altering pandemic 
                    has spread and infected over 60% of the world's population. Since the outbreak, the world has gone into 
                    a state of panic and frenzy as officials try to fix and keep the situation under control. When the World 
                    Health Organization's attempts to procure a vaccine fail, the United States government does away with the 
                    bureaucrats in power and the establishment of civilian government. The country is turned into a police 
                    state under the control of homeland security and the military, and cities across the nation are placed 
                    under martial law one by one. Survivors of the pandemic are assigned to designated quarantine zones that 
                    are supposed to separate them from the infected and keep them safe.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sometime within the twenty years leading up to the main events of the game, a paramilitary group calling 
                    themselves the Fireflies is established, with their main goal being the restoration of lawful government 
                    in the United States, as well as finding and producing a vaccine for the Cordyceps brain infection. The Fireflies 
                    attack the military on occasion and encourage uprisings.

                            law and have earned a reputation for their ruthless behavior. She and Joel have a trust that runs deeply

                            to aid Joel and Ellie in finding a car. Bill possesses gay pornography, and showed heavy emotion for his friend Frank's death, 
                            implying that he was romantically involved with Frank.</p>

                            Marlene tells Tess and Joel to take Ellie to the Fireflies at the Capitol building in Boston. To Marlene, 
                            every unethical action she takes can be justified because of her pursuit to save humanity from the infection.

                            reunite later and he reluctantly agrees to help his brother, establishing one of Joel and Ellie's

                            asks for help from Ellie. David is a very manipulative person, seeking to win people over with his 
                            superficial mild-mannered appearance, and attempts to convince Ellie to join him. He has a very profound effect on Ellie 
                            throughout the rest of the game.</p>

                            is the last person Sam talks to before he turns. </p>
